# Graph Neural Network Workshop

This repo was created to contain material used for [ICAC 2022](https://icac.lk/) (4th International Conference on Advancements in Computing) workshop on [Graph Neural Networks: Theory and Applications](https://icac.lk/workshops/).

Our workshop is divided into 3 parts 

 1. **Session 1:** Introduction to fundamental theory and concepts of GNNs.
 2. **Session 2:** Tutorial 1 on one of the popular GNN variant which is Graph Convolutional Neural Network.
 3. **Session 3:**  Tutorial 2 on GNN application on bitcoin. Here we use GNN to detect fraudulent transaction using a publicly available bitcoin graph dataset.

**Note:** The notebooks are designed to run standalone, so they contain all the necessary  installation setup. We highly suggest to run these notebooks in Google colab.
